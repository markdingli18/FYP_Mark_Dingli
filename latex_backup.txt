\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}
This \acrshort{fyp} is an integration of machine learning techniques with a physics based Lagrangian model~\cite{1} to address the environmental issues of sea debris. At the core of this project is a pipeline that harnesses historical data to forecast future conditions, specifically predicting the next 24 hours of sea surface currents. These predictions serve as inputs for a Lagrangian model~\cite{1}, enabling it to simulate the movement of surface marine debris. Finally, a comparative evaluation of both \acrshort{lstm} and \acrshort{gru} models is conducted, focusing on their predictive accuracy and the quality of the visualisations. This project introduces an approach of merging machine learning with a physics-based model, offering valuable insights to marine conservation efforts and improving decision-making for managing marine debris around the Maltese Islands. 

\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem_definition}
Sea surface debris around the coastal waters of Malta presents a significant environmental challenge. Predominantly composed of plastics, which constitute 82\% of all man-made floating items encountered in the Mediterranean sea~\cite{2}, this debris endangers marine life, disrupts ecological balances, and undermines the ecological integrity of coastal areas~\cite{3}. This problem is further aggravated by the lack of an effective system that can predict and forecast the movement of this surface debris, since as of writing, there exists no system that adequately addresses this challenge specifically for the coastal areas around Malta. This further underscores the need for a system that can accurately predict and visualise the dispersion patterns of sea surface debris.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
The geological characteristics of the Mediterranean sea makes it difficult for surface debris to  escape the area naturally, leading to the accumulation of sea surface debris ~\cite{4}. The current absence of a predictive system tailored to the coastal regions of Malta impedes effective interventions to mitigate environmental harm. This gap opens an opportunity for the implementation of a system that through the application of Machine Learning and physics-based modelling, aims to address an urgent ecological issue, which is widely recognised as a global crisis~\cite{5}. By fulfilling this need, the project aims to provide accurate predictions that can guide effective cleanup operations and inform strategies for long-term marine conservation around the surrounding waters of Malta. 

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\label{sec:aims_and_objectives}
The aim of this project is to create a system enhanced with Machine Learning for simulating and predicting the movement of marine debris in the coastal waters of Malta, thereby supporting marine conservation efforts. To achieve this aim, the following objectives have been identified:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{0\arabic*.}] % Customize the label format
    \item \textbf{Data integration:} To preprocess and integrate the sea surface currents datasets ensuring compatibility and consistency for input into both models.
    \item \textbf{Lagrangian model development:} To develop a Lagrangian physics-based model for simulating the movement of surface marine debris, employing historical data to ensure accurate simulations.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:proposed_solution}
This project aims to develop an integrated pipeline for predicting and simulating the movement of marine debris around Malta's coastal waters. The process begins with the preprocessing of the sea surface currents datasets that will be used as input for the subsequent modelling stages. A Lagrangian model will be developed to visualise the debris movement. This approach is designed to clarify both the expected input from the \acrshort{ai} models and the expected nature of the ensuing visualisations. The core of the solution involves developing and fine-tuning two types of machine learning models: \acrshort{lstm} and \acrshort{gru}. These models will undergo extensive testing to determine the optimal architecture and hyper-parameters, aiming to accurately predict sea surface currents for a future 24-hour period. 

Upon establishing the predictive models, the pipeline integrates these predictions into the Lagrangian model, transforming the predicted data into dynamic visualisations of future debris movement. The project culminates in a comparative analysis of the \acrshort{lstm} and \acrshort{gru} models, evaluating their effectiveness through various metrics, including their predictive accuracy and the quality of the generated visualisations. By analysing the results and visualisations, this project aims to provide actionable insights for effective cleanup operations and strategies for long-term marine conservation around the coastal waters of Malta.

\section{Summary of Results}

The results demonstrate the system's capability to make accurate 24-hour predictions and dynamically visualise the trajectory of marine debris. Through comparative evaluation, it was determined that the \acrshort{lstm} model outperforms the \acrshort{gru} model in predicting sea surface current velocities. These findings validate the effectiveness of the integrated approach and demonstrate its potential to enhance marine conservation efforts.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}
\label{chp:background_and_literature_review}
In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive background for the project, while also presenting an overview of pertinent academic papers and literature to underpin the project’s scientific foundations.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
This section is divided into five distinct segments where we collectively provide detailed information regarding this project. First, we begin with an exploration of the impacts of marine debris on ecosystems and also delve into the specific datasets used in this project. Then, we discuss the intricacies of the physics based Lagrangian Model, provide an explanation of time series analysis, and finally round off with an exposition on deep learning models, specifically \acrshort{lstm}s and \acrshort{gru}s.

\subsection{The impact of marine debris on ecosystems}%
\label{subsec:2.1.1}
The environmental and ecological impact of marine debris, particularly in coastal and marine ecosystems, has been extensively researched, as evidenced by~\cite{6} and~\cite{7}. Several studies in this area reveal significant negative effects, ranging from harm to marine wildlife due to ingestion and entanglement~\cite{8}, to the disruption of natural habitats~\cite{9}. The impact on coastal ecosystems extends beyond the environment, affecting economic sectors reliant on marine health, such as tourism and fishing as discussed in~\cite{9}. Further research delves into the long-term ecological consequences, highlighting the urgent need for effective management and mitigation strategies as seen in~\cite{10}. These studies collectively emphasise the critical nature of addressing marine debris for ecosystem sustainability and conservation. 

\subsection{The Dataset}
\label{subsec:2.1.2}
The dataset forms the backbone of any project, with its selection and preprocessing being crucial for creating subsequent models. In this project we utilise a single type of dataset which is provided by the Department of Geosciences at the University of Malta.

This dataset consists of sea surface currents velocity data, recorded in hourly increments across four years, spanning from January 2020 to December 2023. These data points are derived from a model generated by high-frequency (HF) radar systems ~\cite{11}, located on the northern parts of the Maltese islands and southern Sicily. The locations of these radar systems, depicted in Figure~\ref{2.1} and identified from~\cite{12}, provide a temporal snapshot of the sea surface currents movements.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{radar_locations.pdf}
    \caption[Short sample caption.]{High Frequency Radars Locations\label{2.1}}
\end{figure}

The data is composed of several variables including longitude, latitude, and time, coupled with eastern and northern sea current velocities; denoted as \textit{'u'} and \textit{'v'}. The variable \textit{'u'} signifies the east-west current component, indicating the velocity at which surface currents travel horizontally, either eastwards (positive \textit{'u'}) or westwards (negative \textit{'u'}). Similarly, \textit{'v'} represents the north-south current component, denoting vertical movement towards the north (positive \textit{'V'}) or south (negative \textit{'v'}). The data's geographical scope is defined within the boundaries of 14.15° to 14.81° longitude and 35.79° to 36.30° latitude. This coverage translates into a grid of 52 latitude points by 43 longitude points, for a total of 180 data points, as detailed in Figure 2.2. The dataset is in \acrshort{netcdf} format~\cite{13}, a commonly used standard for climate and meteorological data, ensuring compatibility with the Lagrangian Model employed in the simulations.

    \caption[Short sample caption.]{Radar Data Points Locations for Dataset\label{2.2}}
\end{figure}

This dataset is integral to the project, providing comprehensive environmental parameters essential for the subsequent development of both the physics-based simulations and the Machine Learning models.

\subsection{Physics-Based Lagrangian Model}
\label{subsec:2.1.3}
The practice of tracking ocean surface movements in a Lagrangian framework dates back to the earliest days of oceanography, with early methods involving observing the drift of ships or the paths of specially designed floats to document current movement, as outlined by~\cite{14}. The physics based Lagrangian model~\cite{1} plays a pivotal role in environmental simulations. By offering a dynamic method to trace individual particle trajectories within fluid mediums, the model ensures precise tracking of the particle’s temporal movement. Its broad applicability spans from localised studies, to complex, global-scale environmental systems, underlining its adaptability. This is evident in its varied applications, which include tracking oil spills diffusion~\cite{15}, mapping floating plastic debris~\cite{16}, simulating jellyfish migrations~\cite{17}, analysing smoke dispersion~\cite{18}, and many other.

The physics based Lagrangian model~\cite{1} operates by representing particles within a fluid medium, tracking their position and properties as they move with the fluid’s flow. The model calculates the trajectory of each particle by integrating the velocity field of the fluid, which may vary in time and space. This approach enables the simulation of dispersal patterns of particles, such as marine debris by accounting for both advection and diffusion processes. Advection represents the movement of particles by the flow of the fluid~\cite{19}. Diffusion, on the other hand, models the dispersion of particles through random motion~\cite{19}. This is done by employing techniques such as random walks or Gaussian distributions. This inclusion of randomness enhances the realism of the simulation.

To facilitate these simulations, several Python toolkits like OceanParcels~\cite{20}, PyGnome~\cite{21}, and Flexpart~\cite{22} have been developed, each specifically designed for simulating the movement of particles using the Lagrangian model framework. These toolkits enable the customisation and execution of particle tracking simulations, leveraging data on ocean currents, wind fields, and other environmental phenomena.

OceanParcels~\cite{20} is distinguished by several features that make it suitable for our project. One of its notable capabilities are custom kernels. These are user-defined functions that allow for tailored simulation scenarios at each time step. Through custom kernels, users can implement complex behaviours and interactions of particles within the fluid, such as particle reflection or response to environmental variables like temperature and wind. Another significant feature is particle initialisation. This feature enables the creation of particles at specific locations, times, and with distinct properties, allowing for more detailed and accurate simulations. 

All these attributes render OceanParcels~\cite{20} as an optimal choice for this project. By integrating these features, this toolkit facilitates the development of comprehensive simulations. This is crucial for understanding and predicting the movement of marine debris, thereby enhancing our strategies for marine conservation and debris management.

\subsection{Time Series Modelling}
\label{subsec:2.1.4}
Time series modelling is a technique used to predict future data points by analysing the trends, cycles, and patterns in a series of data points collected over an interval of time~\cite{23}. Its main focus is on analysing historical data to uncover the underlying structure of the dataset, which can then be used to forecast future trends. This method is particularly powerful for its ability to incorporate the sequence and time dependence within the dataset. By examining how values are interconnected over time, time series models can forecast future values based on the inherent temporal dynamics present in the historical data~\cite{24}. This form of predictive modelling assumes that past patterns are indicative of future behaviours, making it an indispensable tool in a variety of fields ranging from weather forecasting~\cite{25} to stock market predictions~\cite{26}. 

While time series modelling is a powerful tool for forecasting future data, it also encounters several limitations. Time series data often exhibit seasonality and trends, which can complicate the forecasting process~\cite{27}. Outliers, missing sequences of data, and anomalies can also significantly impact the accuracy of forecasting models, requiring careful identification, and handling. The capacity of these models to integrate external influential factors and variables is also somewhat limited, often necessitating the integration of additional features for enhanced predictive accuracy~\cite{28}. Additionally, time series models require significantly more data for training, which can be a challenge in situations where data is limited~\cite{28}. These challenges highlight the importance of adopting a methodical approach to time series modelling, emphasising the need to carefully consider the specific context and characteristics of the data being analysed when utilising time series models for effective forecasting.

In the context of this project, we harness time series modelling to predict sea surface current velocities. Accurate predictions require  a detailed analyses of the data sequences to discern patterns that could forecast future predictions. The historical hourly data of surface currents form a time series, which is inherently continuous but sampled at discrete intervals. To address this, deep learning models, a subset of artificial neural networks, are employed due to their proficiency in handling vast amounts of sequential data and their capacity to learn complex temporal patterns~\cite{29}. Through training on past sea surface current data, these models are equipped to predict future values.

\subsection{Deep Learning Models}
\label{subsec:2.1.5}
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that harnesses the power of \acrshort{ann}s to interpret and predict data through multiple layers~\cite{30}. Deep learning has revolutionised the way we approach complex problems by being able to detect intricate patterns from different types of data~\cite{30}. In the context of this \acrshort{fyp}, deep learning models are pivotal in analysing and predicting the dynamic and complex patterns of sea surface current velocities. By employing models specific to sequential data processing like \acrshort{lstm} and \acrshort{gru} networks, this project aims to accurately predict the dispersion of marine debris around Malta's coastal waters, addressing both the temporal dynamics and spatial complexities inherent in sea current movements.

\acrshort{lstm} networks, a specialised type of \acrshort{rnn}s, are designed to address the challenge of learning long-term dependencies, overcoming the limitations faced by traditional \acrshort{rnn}s, notably the vanishing gradient problem~\cite{31}. This challenge inhibits \acrshort{rnn}s from effectively learning and retaining information over long sequences.\acrshort{lstm}s employ a unique architecture, characterised by a system of gates, namely the input, forget, and output gates. These gates collectively decide which information should be stored, discarded, or passed through, based on the relevance to the task at hand~\cite{32}. Memory cells within \acrshort{lstm}s retain information over long intervals, making them adept at managing sequences where understanding past context is crucial for future predictions~\cite{32}. This capability is pivotal for predicting sea surface currents, as demonstrated in this \acrshort{fyp}. Their ability to remember previous information for extended durations without degradation makes them ideal for capturing the underlying patterns in historical data of sea surface currents, which is crucial for accurate prediction and subsequent debris dispersion simulation.

 \acrshort{gru} networks are another variant of \acrshort{rnn}s that aim to solve the vanishing gradient problem~\cite{31} but with a more simplified structure compared to \acrshort{lstm}s. \acrshort{gru}s simplify the LSTM model by combining the input and forget gates into a single update gate and merging the cell state and hidden state~\cite{32},~\cite{33}. This reduction in complexity leads to a model that is faster to train without significantly compromising the model's ability to capture dependencies in a sequence~\cite{32}. In the context of this project, \acrshort{gru}s are employed alongside \acrshort{lstm}s to forecast sea surface currents. Their efficiency and effectiveness in handling time series data render them adapt at predicting the movements of marine debris, offering a comparative perspective to the \acrshort{lstm}'s performance.

 In conclusion, \acrshort{lstm}s and \acrshort{gru}s distinguish themselves primarily through their structure and information processing: \acrshort{lstm}s offer a more detailed gating mechanism that excels in managing long-term dependencies, while \acrshort{gru}s provide a streamlined architecture that enables quicker training without significantly sacrificing performance~\cite{33}. Their inherent capabilities make them exceptionally suited for time series modelling, where understanding and predicting sequential data patterns is crucial~\cite{29}, thereby making them highly applicable to the objectives of this \acrshort{fyp}. It is for these reasons that both models were leveraged in this project, utilising their strengths to predict future sea surface current velocities from historical data. Their performances were also compared against one another, aiding in the accurate simulation of marine debris dispersion around Malta's coastal waters.

 \section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature_review}
This section outlines the structure of the literature review, which is divided into three distinct subsections, each focusing on a critical aspect of marine debris dispersion and the methodologies employed to predict and simulate it. The first subsection delves into studies that forecast the movement and accumulation of marine debris. The second subsection highlights research that applies machine learning techniques to predict sea surface currents. The final subsection explores the integration between \acrshort{ai} models predictions and physics-based models. The goal is to provide an overview of current methodologies in the field.

\subsection{Prediction of Marine Debris Dispersal }
\label{subsec:2.2.1}
The prediction of marine debris dispersal has significant impact on marine ecosystems. This is why researchers have explored multiple methodologies to understand and forecast the movement and accumulation zones of debris in marine environments. The variation in these approaches reflects the complexity of the problem, encompassing various methods that aim to capture the dynamic nature of marine debris movement. Through the implementation of numerical simulations~\cite{34},~\cite{35}, deep learning techniques~\cite{36}, and advanced simulation tools~\cite{37},~\cite{38}, the field continues to evolve, seeking more accurate and efficient ways to predict debris dispersal patterns. 

E. van Sebille et al.~\cite{34} delve into marine debris dispersal, focusing on the crucial role of numerical simulations in predicting and understanding the dispersion of marine debris. This study utilises a number of numerical simulations that leverage various physical oceanographic phenomena to model the movement of floating marine debris. Central to their approach is the use of extensive datasets, capturing various environmental factors such as the velocity and direction of ocean currents, wind patterns, and wave dynamics. These variables are crucial for determining the dispersal patterns of marine debris.
