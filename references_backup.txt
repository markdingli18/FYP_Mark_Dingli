	abstract={Studying oceanography by using Lagrangian simulations has been adopted for a range of scenarios, such as the determining the fate of microplastics in the ocean, simulating the origin locations of microplankton used for palaeoceanographic reconstructions, and for studying the impact of fish aggregation devices on the migration behaviour of tuna. These simulations are complex and represent a considerable runtime effort to obtain trajectory results, which is the prime motivation for enhancing the performance of Lagrangian particle simulators. This paper assesses established performance enhancing techniques from Eulerian simulators in light of computational conditions and demands of Lagrangian simulators. A performance enhancement strategy specifically targeting physics-based Lagrangian particle simulations is outlined to address the performance gaps, and techniques for closing the performance gap are presented and implemented. Realistic experiments are derived from three specific oceanographic application scenarios, and the suggested performance-enhancing techniques are benchmarked in detail, so to allow for a good attribution of speed-up measurements to individual techniques. The impacts and insights of the performance enhancement strategy are further discussed for Lagrangian simulations in other geoscience applications. The experiments show that I/O-enhancing techniques, such as dynamic loading and buffering, lead to considerable speed-up on-par with an idealised parallelisation of the process over 20 nodes. Conversely, while the cache-efficient structure-of-arrays collection yields a visible speed-up, other alternative data structures fail in fulfilling the theoretically-expected performance increase. This insight demonstrates the importance of good data alignment in memory and caches for Lagrangian physics simulations.},

	note={ID: 271800},
	abstract={Plastic marine pollution is an increasing threat to global marine diversity. Quantifying this threat is particularly difficult and complex, especially when evaluating multiple species with different ecological requirements. Here, we examine the semi-enclosed basin of the Mediterranean Sea where the inputs of plastic pollution and its impact on marine diversity are still widely unknown. Eighty-four species from six taxonomic classes were evaluated to assess the risk of ingesting plastic marine debris, integrating inter-specific factors such as plastic exposure rates and life history traits (e.g., motility, habitat, and body size). Species were modelled within a spatial context to identify and estimate their exposure to plastic ingestion across the Mediterranean Sea using literature data, species distribution maps and plastic dispersion models. Our approach identified hotspots for the risk of plastic ingestion across multiple taxa in the Mediterranean Sea, highlighting that coastal species are at higher risk of ingesting plastic in the marine environment than open-sea species. The plastic exposure analysis indicated that species with larger home ranges were more at risk of exposure with increased distances while local species were more likely to be exposed to plastic closer to the centre of their home range location. The approach used in this study can be applied to support management and mitigation efforts throughout the Mediterranean Sea and in other geographic regions to minimize the impact of plastic pollution on marine diversity.},

	abstract={The Mediterranean Sea is now acknowledged to be a hot spot for marine litter. However, little is known about Floating Macro Litter (FML) concentration at the scale of the entire basin; predictions regarding this would greatly help guide policymaking to fight this scourge. While previous studies have shown high spatio-temporal variability in FML distribution, the aim of this study was to accurately identify seasonal debris accumulation patterns on regional and local spatial scales across the Mediterranean basin. The objective was then to quantitatively compare this distribution model to other simulations and empirical data. We first studied FML distribution with a 2-D Lagrangian model coupled to an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) at a horizontal resolution of 1/12°. From an initial homogeneous deployment, we deployed a set of >108 virtual particles across the whole basin and tracked each particle during 3-month journeys. Then we described the FML distribution model outputs and compared them both to empirical observations at the scale of the whole basin (gathered from a review of scientific papers on surface debris distribution), and to other numerical FML simulations from previous studies. The results of our offshore modeled distribution of FML fully agreed with characteristic debris accumulation patterns analyzed in our review of other studies. This indicates that our model could allow the prediction of monthly litter accumulation patterns at the scale of the entire Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract={This chapter traces the history of marine litter research from anecdotal reports of entanglement and plastic ingestion in the 1960s to the current focus on microplastics and their role in the transfer of persistent organic pollutants to marine food webs. The reports in Science of large numbers of plastic pellets in the North Atlantic in the early 1970s stimulated research interest in plastic litter at sea, with papers reporting plastics on the seafloor and impacting a variety of marine animals. The focus then shifted to high concentrations of plastic litter in the North Pacific, where novel studies reported the dynamics of stranded beach litter, the factors influencing plastic ingestion by seabirds, and trends in fur seal entanglement. By the early 1980s, growing concern about the potential impacts of marine litter resulted in a series of meetings on marine debris. The first two international conferences held in Honolulu by the US National Marine Fisheries Service played a key role in setting the research agenda for the next decade. By the end of the 1980s, most impacts of marine litter were reasonably well understood, and attention shifted to seeking effective solutions to tackle the marine litter problem. Research was largely restricted to monitoring trends in litter to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures, until the last decade, when concern about microplastics coupled with the discovery of alarming densities of small plastic particles in the North Pacific ‘garbage patch’ (and other mid-ocean gyres) stimulated the current wave of research.},

This perception was a seminal finding of the 1984 International Workshop on the Fate and Impact of Marine Debris (Shomura and Yoshida 1985). A major factor leading to this conclusion was information on the nature and extent of interactions between marine debris and marine life gathered by researchers working independently in different ocean areas during the 1970s and early 1980s. Compiled for the first time at the 1984 workshop, the information highlighted two fundamental types of biological interactions: (1) entanglement, whereby the loops and openings of various types of debris entangle animal appendages or entrap animals; and (2) ingestion, whereby debris items are intentionally or accidentally eaten and enter the digestive tract.},

	abstract={Anthropogenic debris contaminates marine habitats globally, leading to several perceived ecological impacts. Here, we critically and systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from several scientific fields to understand the weight of evidence regarding the ecological impacts of marine debris. We quantified perceived and demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization that make up the ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats were tested, 83% of which were demonstrated. The majority (82%) of demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative to other materials (e.g., metals, glass) and largely (89%) at suborganismal levels (e.g., molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at higher levels of organization (i.e., death to individual organisms, changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris (> 1 mm; e.g., rope, straws, and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of ecological impacts from marine debris, but conclude that the quantity and quality of research requires improvement to allow the risk of ecological impacts of marine debris to be determined with precision. Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now, to avoid risk of irreversible harm.},

	abstract={Marine debris, defined as any persistent manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment, has been highlighted as a contaminant of global environmental and economic concern. The five main categories of marine debris comprise of plastic, paper, metal, textile, glass and rubber. Plastics is recognised as the major constituent of marine debris, representing between 50% and 90% of the total marine debris found globally. Between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tonnes of consumer plastics end up in the world oceans annually, resulting in the presence of more than 100 million particles of macroplastics in only 12 regional seas worldwide, and with 51 trillion particles of microplastic floating on the ocean surface globally. The impacts of marine debris can be branched out into three categories; injury to or death of marine organisms, harm to marine environment and effects on human health and economy. Marine mammals often accidentally ingest marine debris because of its appearance that can easily be mistaken as food. Moreover, floating plastics may act as vehicles for chemicals and/or environmental contaminants, which may be absorbed on to their surface during their use and permanence into the environment. Additionally, floating plastics is a potential vector for the introduction of invasive species that get attached to it, into the marine environment. In addition, human beings are not excluded from the impact of marine debris as they become exposed to microplastics through seafood consumption. Moreover, landscape degradation owing to debris accumulation is an eyesore and aesthetically unpleasant, thus resulting in decreased tourism and subsequent income loss. There are a wide range of initiatives that have been taken to tackle the issue of marine debris. They may involve manual removal of marine debris from coastal and aquatic environment in form of programmes and projects organised, such as beach clean-ups by scientific communities, non-governmental organizations and the removal of marine litter from Europe's four regional seas, respectively. Other initiatives focus on assessment, reduction, prevention and management of marine debris under the umbrella of international (the United Nations Environment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan, the Oslo/Paris Convention) and regional organisations - that is, the Helsinki Commission. There are also a number of international conventions and national regulations that encourage mitigation and management of marine debris. However, it is argued that these initiatives are short-term unsustainable solutions and the long-term sustainable solution would be adoption of circular economy. Similarly, four of the sustainable developmental goals have targets that promote mitigation of marine debris by efficient waste management and practice of 3R. As evident by the Ad Hoc Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics meeting, tackling the marine debris crisis is not a straightforward, one-size-fits-all solution, but rather an integrated and continuous effort required at local, regional and global level.},

Here, we review the state of the art in the field of Lagrangian analysis of ocean velocity data, starting from a fundamental kinematic framework and with a focus on large-scale open ocean applications. Beyond the use of explicit velocity fields, we consider the influence of unresolved physics and dynamics on particle trajectories. We comprehensively list and discuss the tools currently available for tracking virtual particles. We then showcase some of the innovative applications of trajectory data, and conclude with some open questions and an outlook. The overall goal of this review paper is to reconcile some of the different techniques and methods in Lagrangian ocean analysis, while recognising the rich diversity of codes that have and continue to emerge, and the challenges of the coming age of petascale computing.},

A global ocean circulation model is coupled to a Lagrangian particle tracking model to simulate 30years of input, transport and accumulation of floating debris in the world ocean. Using both terrestrial and maritime inputs, the modelling results clearly show the formation of five accumulation zones in the subtropical latitudes of the major ocean basins. The relative size and concentration of each clearly illustrate the dominance of the accumulation zones in the northern hemisphere, while smaller seas surrounded by densely populated areas are also shown to have a high concentration of floating debris. We also determine the relative contribution of different source regions to the total amount of material in a particular accumulation zone. This study provides a framework for describing the transport, distribution and accumulation of floating marine debris and can be continuously updated and adapted to assess scenarios reflecting changes in the production and disposal of plastic worldwide.},

	journal={Journal of geophysical research. Atmospheres},
	volume={120},
	number={24},
	pages={12605-12630},
	abstract={Transboundary smoke haze caused by biomass burning frequently causes extreme air pollution episodes in maritime and continental Southeast Asia. With millions of people being affected by this type of pollution every year, the task to introduce smoke haze related air quality forecasts is urgent. We investigate three severe haze episodes: June 2013 in Maritime SE Asia, induced by fires in central Sumatra, and March/April 2013 and 2014 on mainland SE Asia. Based on comparisons with surface measurements of PM10 we demonstrate that the combination of the Lagrangian dispersion model NAME with emissions derived from satellite‐based active‐fire detection provides reliable forecasts for the region. Contrasting two fire emission inventories shows that using algorithms to account for fire pixel obscuration by cloud or haze better captures the temporal variations and observed persistence of local pollution levels. Including up‐to‐date representations of fuel types in the area and using better conversion and emission factors is found to more accurately represent local concentration magnitudes, particularly for peat fires. With both emission inventories the overall spatial and temporal evolution of the haze events is captured qualitatively, with some error attributed to the resolution of the meteorological data driving the dispersion process. In order to arrive at a quantitative agreement with local PM10 levels, the simulation results need to be scaled. Considering the requirements of operational forecasts, we introduce a real‐time bias correction technique to the modeling system to address systematic and random modeling errors, which successfully improves the results in terms of reduced normalized mean biases and fractional gross errors.

	title={The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART version 10.4},
	abstract={The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART in its original version in the mid-1990s was designed for calculating the long-range and mesoscale dispersion of hazardous substances from point sources, such as those released after an accident in a nuclear power plant. Over the past decades, the model has evolved into a comprehensive tool for multi-scale atmospheric transport modeling and analysis and has attracted a global user community. Its application fields have been extended to a large range of atmospheric gases and aerosols, e.g., greenhouse gases, short-lived climate forcers like black carbon and volcanic ash, and it has also been used to study the atmospheric branch of the water cycle. Given suitable meteorological input data, it can be used for scales from dozens of meters to global. In particular, inverse modeling based on source–receptor relationships from FLEXPART has become widely used. In this paper, we present FLEXPART version 10.4, which works with meteorological input data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) and data from the United States National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). Since the last publication of a detailed FLEXPART description (version 6.2), the model has been improved in different aspects such as performance, physicochemical parameterizations, input/output formats, and available preprocessing and post-processing software. The model code has also been parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We demonstrate that the model scales well up to using 256 processors, with a parallel efficiency greater than 75 % for up to 64 processes on multiple nodes in runs with very large numbers of particles. The deviation from 100 % efficiency is almost entirely due to the remaining nonparallelized parts of the code, suggesting large potential for further speedup. A new turbulence scheme for the convective boundary layer has been developed that considers the skewness in the vertical velocity distribution (updrafts and downdrafts) and vertical gradients in air density. FLEXPART is the only model available considering both effects, making it highly accurate for small-scale applications, e.g., to quantify dispersion in the vicinity of a point source. The wet deposition scheme for aerosols has been completely rewritten and a new, more detailed gravitational settling parameterization for aerosols has also been implemented. FLEXPART has had the option of running backward in time from atmospheric concentrations at receptor locations for many years, but this has now been extended to also work for deposition values and may become useful, for instance, for the interpretation of ice core measurements. To our knowledge, to date FLEXPART is the only model with that capability. Furthermore, the temporal variation and temperature dependence of chemical reactions with the OH radical have been included, allowing for more accurate simulations for species with intermediate lifetimes against the reaction with OH, such as ethane. Finally, user settings can now be specified in a more flexible namelist format, and output files can be produced in NetCDF format instead of FLEXPART's customary binary format. In this paper, we describe these new developments. Moreover, we present some tools for the preparation of the meteorological input data and for processing FLEXPART output data, and we briefly report on alternative FLEXPART versions.

	pages={249-285},
	abstract={Interval time series forecasting can be used for forecasting special symbolic data comprising lower and upper bounds and plays an important role in handling the complexity, instability, and uncertainty of observed objects. The purpose of this research is to identify the most widely used definition of interval time series; classify existing research into mature research, current research focus, and research gaps within the defined framework; and recommend future directions for interval forecasting research. To achieve this goal, we have conducted a systematic literature review, comprising search strategy planning, screening mechanism determination, document analysis, and report generation. During the search strategy planning stage, eight literature search libraries are selected to obtain the most extensive studies (total of 525 targets). In the screening‐mechanism determination stage, through the inclusion and exclusion mechanism, the literature that is repetitive, of low‐relevance, and from other fields are discarded, and 125 studies are finally selected. In the document analysis stage, tag‐based methods and classification grids are selected to analyze the shortlisted studies. The results show that there are still numerous research gaps in interval time series forecasting, such as the establishment of hybrid models, application of multisource information, development and application of evaluation techniques, and expansion of application scenarios. In the report‐generation stage, the problems that have been solved and encountered in interval forecasting are summarized, and future research directions are proposed. Finally, the most significant contribution of this research is to provide an overview of interval time series forecasting for easy reference by researchers and to facilitate further research.},

	abstract={Time-series forecasting has been an important research domain for so many years. Its applications include ECG predictions, sales forecasting, weather conditions, even COVID-19 spread predictions. These applications have motivated many researchers to figure out an optimal forecasting approach, but the modeling approach also changes as the application domain changes. This work has focused on reviewing different forecasting approaches for telemetry data predictions collected at data centers. Forecasting of telemetry data is a critical feature of network and data center management products. However, there are multiple options of forecasting approaches that range from a simple linear statistical model to high capacity deep learning architectures. In this paper, we attempted to summarize and evaluate the performance of well known time series forecasting techniques. We hope that this evaluation provides a comprehensive summary to innovate in forecasting approaches for telemetry data.},

	abstract={A prominent area of data analytics is “timeseries modeling” where it is possible to forecast future values for the same variable using previous data. Numerous usage examples, including the economy, the weather, stock prices, and the development of a corporation, demonstrate its significance. Experiments with time series forecasting utilizing machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and AutoML are conducted in this paper. Its primary contribution consists of addressing the forecasting problem by experimenting with additional ML and DL models and AutoML frameworks and expanding the AutoML experimental knowledge. In addition, it contributes by breaking down barriers found in past experimental studies in this field by using more sophisticated methods. The datasets this empirical research utilized were secondary quantitative data of the real prices of the currently most used cryptocurrencies. We found that AutoML for timeseries is still in the development stage and necessitates more study to be a viable solution since it was unable to outperform manually designed ML and DL models. The demonstrated approaches may be utilized as a baseline for predicting timeseries data.},

	abstract={Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays considered as a core technology of today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.},

	journal={AI},
	volume={2},
	number={4},
	pages={496},
	abstract={Cryptocurrency is a new sort of asset that has emerged as a result of the advancement of financial technology and it has created a big opportunity for researches. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Around the world, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies that are used. This paper proposes three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms used to predict the prices of three types of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH). The models show excellent predictions depending on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results obtained from these models show that the gated recurrent unit (GRU) performed better in prediction for all types of cryptocurrency than the long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) models. Therefore, it can be considered the best algorithm. GRU presents the most accurate prediction for LTC with MAPE percentages of 0.2454%, 0.8267%, and 0.2116% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. The bi-LSTM algorithm presents the lowest prediction result compared with the other two algorithms as the MAPE percentages are: 5.990%, 6.85%, and 2.332% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. Overall, the prediction models in this paper represent accurate results close to the actual prices of cryptocurrencies. The importance of having these models is that they can have significant economic ramifications by helping investors and traders to pinpoint cryptocurrency sales and purchasing. As a plan for future work, a recommendation is made to investigate other factors that might affect the prices of cryptocurrency market such as social media, tweets, and trading volume.},

	abstract={Marine plastic debris floating on the ocean surface is a major environmental problem. However, its distribution in the ocean is poorly mapped, and most of the plastic waste estimated to have entered the ocean from land is unaccounted for. Better understanding of how plastic debris is transported from coastal and marine sources is crucial to quantify and close the global inventory of marine plastics, which in turn represents critical information for mitigation or policy strategies. At the same time, plastic is a unique tracer that provides an opportunity to learn more about the physics and dynamics of our ocean across multiple scales, from the Ekman convergence in basin-scale gyres to individual waves in the surfzone. In this review, we comprehensively discuss what is known about the different processes that govern the transport of floating marine plastic debris in both the open ocean and the coastal zones, based on the published literature and referring to insights from neighbouring fields such as oil spill dispersion, marine safety recovery, plankton connectivity, and others. We discuss how measurements of marine plastics (both in situ and in the laboratory), remote sensing, and numerical simulations can elucidate these processes and their interactions across spatio-temporal scales.},

	abstract={Numerical modelling is one of the key tools with which we can gain insight into the distribution of marine litter, especially micro-plastics. Over the past decade, a series of numerical simulations have been constructed that specifically target floating marine litter, based on ocean models of various complexity. Some of these models include the effects of currents, waves and wind as well as a series of processes that impact how particles interact with ocean currents, including fragmentation and degradation. Here, we give an overview of these models, including their spatial and temporal resolution, limitations, availability, and what we have learned from them. Then we focus on floating marine micro-plastics (<5mm diameter) and we make recommendations for experimental research efforts that can improve the skill of the models by increasing our understanding of the processes that govern the dispersion of marine litter. In addition, we highlight the importance of knowing accurately the sources or entry points of marine plastic debris, including potential sources that have not been incorporated in previous studies (e.g. atmospheric contributions). Finally, we identify information gaps and priority work areas for research. We also highlight the need for appreciating and acknowledging the uncertainty that persists regarding the movement, transportation and accumulation of anthropogenic litter in the marine environment.},

	abstract={Marine debris is a global crisis impacting human health, wildlife, and coastal economies. Remote sensing and geospatial technologies are an efficient way to document marine debris across large areas, but the high costs of fieldwork and manual interpretation of debris imagery are major barriers to broader use of these methods. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have brought rapid automation to many remote sensing domains, including the detection and classification of marine debris. This study evaluates the ability to detect and classify coastline marine debris objects in a real-world setting across a large geographic extent. Three leading ML object detection models were trained to detect and classify large shoreline stranded marine debris from a set of aerial images collected over 1,900 km of Hawaiian coastline. The three models evaluated 1,587 image chips containing 10,703 individual debris labels from 8 debris classes. The SS-MN was both the fastest model and provided the best percentage of accurate predictions, achieving an average precision of 72 %. Nonetheless, this performance was achieved at the expense of missing numerous debris objects, with an average recall of 40 %. The other models provided distinct advantages for certain object classes and use cases. The results show that ML techniques show strong potential to automatically detect and classify certain types of marine debris from aerial surveys. However, there are existing methodological and technical challenges left to overcome before ML methods can outperform human observers in manual interpretation of marine debris from imagery.},

	abstract={We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For $$300 \times 300$$300×300input, SSD achieves 74.3 % mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $$512 \times 512$$512×512input, SSD achieves 76.9 % mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd.},

	journal={Ocean Modelling},
	volume={188},
	pages={102310},
	abstract={In this paper, we describe methods to verify the adequacy and accuracy of Lagrangian particles from a Lagrangian model to reproduce the concentrations of a passive tracer from an Eulerian-model in river plumes. The modelling simulates plumes from two major rivers discharging in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, under real-world scenarios. The study has been a part of a major project to aid in the protection of the GBR system from the impacts of extreme events and climate change. We employ the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) activated with its built-in Lagrangian model, and forced with wind fields from global models and recorded river volume discharges. The ROMS-Lagrangian model tracks the Lagrangian particles using the spatially interpolated velocities computed on the Eulerian ROMS three-dimensional (3D) grid. The Lagrangian particles are released in the river in proportion to the measured river volume flux. We apply a novel technique that exploits Voronoi polygon areas to convert Lagrangian particle separation into a concentration field. This facilitates comparison with the passive tracer concentrations driven by the Eulerian velocities computed on the ROMS 3D grid. We evaluate the fate of Lagrangian particles activated on a 4-km grid resolution with those of equivalent Eulerian tracer concentrations. For validation, we compare the Lagrangian particles with the Eulerian passive tracer simulated using a higher model grid resolution of 500-m, and found that the computed Lagrangian particle concentrations showed similar overall patterns compared to the passive tracer concentrations from both the coarse 4-km, and high-resolution 500-m Eulerian models. The spatial extent of the particles was in better agreement with the coarse 4-km model than with the higher resolution 500-m model. The clustering of particles resulted in structures at finer scales than the Eulerian model, over the high particle density areas that compared well against observations. The Lagrangian particles are able to capture the general river plume patterns seen in the satellite MODIS images and the satellite derived Chlorophyll-a. We further compare the online ROMS model with an offline particle tracker, OceanPARCELS and determined the similarity of results from both online and offline methods. Overall, our study demonstrates the viability to use Lagrangian particles to reproduce the Eulerian tracer properties, which can be combined with particle properties include tracer age providing to enhance the guidance on the distribution and concentration of effluent from localised flooding river events.},

	abstract={In this paper, we analyze the predictability of the ocean currents using
deep learning. More specifically, we apply the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep
learning network to a data set collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Massachusetts Bay between November 2002-February 2003. We
show that the current speed in two horizontal directions, namely u and v, can be predicted using the LSTM. We discuss the effect of training data set on the prediction error
and on the spectral properties of predictions. Depending on the temporal or the spatial
resolution of the data, the prediction times and distances can vary, and in some cases,
they can be very beneficial for the prediction of the ocean current parameters. Our results can find many important applications including but are not limited to predicting
the statistics and characteristics of tidal energy variation, controlling the current induced
vibrations of marine structures and estimation of the wave blocking point by the chaotic
oceanic current and circulation.},

	journal={Forecasting},
	volume={3},
	number={4},
	pages={953},
	abstract={Despite the large efforts made by the ocean modeling community, such as the GODAE (Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment), which started in 1997 and was renamed as OceanPredict in 2019, the prediction of ocean currents has remained a challenge until the present day—particularly in ocean regions that are characterized by rapid changes in their circulation due to changes in atmospheric forcing or due to the release of available potential energy through the development of instabilities. Ocean numerical models’ useful forecast window is no longer than two days over a given area with the best initialization possible. Predictions quickly diverge from the observational field throughout the water and become unreliable, despite the fact that they can simulate the observed dynamics through other variables such as temperature, salinity and sea surface height. Numerical methods such as harmonic analysis are used to predict both short- and long-term tidal currents with significant accuracy. However, they are limited to the areas where the tide was measured. In this study, a new approach to ocean current prediction based on deep learning is proposed. This method is evaluated on the measured energetic currents of the Gulf of Mexico circulation dominated by the Loop Current (LC) at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The approach taken herein consists of dividing the velocity tensor into planes perpendicular to each of the three Cartesian coordinate system directions. A Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network, which is best suited to handling long-term dependencies in the data, was thus used to predict the evolution of the velocity field in each plane, along each of the three directions. The predicted tensors, made of the planes perpendicular to each Cartesian direction, revealed that the model’s prediction skills were best for the flow field in the planes perpendicular to the direction of prediction. Furthermore, the fusion of all three predicted tensors significantly increased the overall skills of the flow prediction over the individual model’s predictions. The useful forecast period of this new model was greater than 4 days with a root mean square error less than 0.05 cm·s−1 and a correlation coefficient of 0.6.},

Therefore, it is necessary to have a further understanding of the condition of the waters in Labuan Bajo, one of them is sea currents. The purpose of this research is to predict sea surface flow velocity and direction using LSTM. There are many prediction methods, one of them is Long short-term memory (LSTM). The fundamental of LSTM is to process information from the previous memory by going through three gates, that is forget gate, input gate, and output gate so the output will be the input in the next process. Based on trials with several parameters namely Hidden Layer, Learning Rate, Batch Size, and Learning rate drop period, it achieved the smallest MAPE values of U and V components of 14.15% and 8.43% with 50 hidden layers, 32 Batch size and 150 Learn rate drop.  },

	note={ID: 271722},
	abstract={Recently, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) near the Korean Peninsula have increased rapidly due to global warming; this phenomenon can lead to high water temperatures and extensive damage to Korean fish farms. To reduce such damage, it is necessary to predict high water temperature events in advance. In this study, we developed a method for predicting high water temperature events using time series SST data for the Korean Peninsula obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 product and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network designed for time series data prediction. First, the SST prediction model was used to predict SSTs. Predicted SSTs exceeding 28 °C, which is the Korean government standard for issuing high water temperature warnings, were designated as high water temperatures. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the SST prediction model, 1-to 7-day predictions were evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The R2, RMSE, and MAPE values of the 1-day prediction SST model were 0.985, 0.14 °C, and 0.38%, respectively, whereas those of the 7-day prediction SST model were 0.574, 0.74 °C, and 2.26%, respectively. We also calculated F1 scores to evaluate high water temperature classification accuracy. The F1 scores of the 1- and 7-day SST prediction models were 0.963 and 0.739, respectively.},

	note={ID: 271817},
	abstract={The Mediterranean Sea is now acknowledged to be a hot spot for marine litter. However, little is known about Floating Macro Litter (FML) concentration at the scale of the entire basin; predictions regarding this would greatly help guide policymaking to fight this scourge. While previous studies have shown high spatio-temporal variability in FML distribution, the aim of this study was to accurately identify seasonal debris accumulation patterns on regional and local spatial scales across the Mediterranean basin. The objective was then to quantitatively compare this distribution model to other simulations and empirical data. We first studied FML distribution with a 2-D Lagrangian model coupled to an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) at a horizontal resolution of 1/12°. From an initial homogeneous deployment, we deployed a set of >108 virtual particles across the whole basin and tracked each particle during 3-month journeys. Then we described the FML distribution model outputs and compared them both to empirical observations at the scale of the whole basin (gathered from a review of scientific papers on surface debris distribution), and to other numerical FML simulations from previous studies. The results of our offshore modeled distribution of FML fully agreed with characteristic debris accumulation patterns analyzed in our review of other studies. This indicates that our model could allow the prediction of monthly litter accumulation patterns at the scale of the entire Mediterranean Sea.},

	pages={5668-5677},
	abstract={Self-supervised learning has gained prominence due to its efficacy at learning powerful representations from unlabelled data that achieve excellent performance on many challenging downstream tasks. However, supervision-free pre-text tasks are challenging to design and usually modality specific. Although there is a rich literature of self-supervised methods for either spatial (such as images) or temporal data (sound or text) modalities, a common pretext task that benefits both modalities is largely missing. In this paper, we are interested in defining a self-supervised pre-text task for sketches and handwriting data. This data is uniquely characterised by its existence in dual modalities of rasterized images and vector coordinate sequences. We address and exploit this dual representation by proposing two novel cross-modal translation pre-text tasks for self-supervised feature learning: Vectorization and Rasterization. Vectorization learns to map image space to vector coordinates and rasterization maps vector coordinates to image space. We show that our learned encoder modules benefit both raster-based and vector-based downstream approaches to analysing hand-drawn data. Empirical evidence shows that our novel pre-text tasks surpass existing single and multi-modal self-supervision methods.},

	abstract={Plastic pollution is ubiquitous throughout the marine environment, yet estimates of the global abundance and weight of floating plastics have lacked data, particularly from the Southern Hemisphere and remote regions. Here we report an estimate of the total number of plastic particles and their weight floating in the world's oceans from 24 expeditions (2007-2013) across all five sub-tropical gyres, costal Australia, Bay of Bengal and the Mediterranean Sea conducting surface net tows (N = 680) and visual survey transects of large plastic debris (N = 891). Using an oceanographic model of floating debris dispersal calibrated by our data, and correcting for wind-driven vertical mixing, we estimate a minimum of 5.25 trillion particles weighing 268,940 tons. When comparing between four size classes, two microplastic 4.75 mm, a tremendous loss of microplastics is observed from the sea surface compared to expected rates of fragmentation, suggesting there are mechanisms at play that remove <4.75 mm plastic particles from the ocean surface.},

	abstract={The application of Machine learning and deep learning techniques for time series forecasting has gained significant attention in recent years. Numerous endeavors have been devoted to automating forecasting through the utilization of cutting-edge neural networks. Notably, the recurrent neural network (LSTM – Long Short-Term Memory) has emerged as a central concept in most research endeavors. Although LSTM was initially introduced in 1997 for sequence modeling, subsequent updates have primarily focused on language learning tasks. These updates have introduced various computational mechanisms within the LSTM cell, including the forget gate, input gate, and output gate. In this study, we investigate the impact of each computational component in isolation to analyze their effects on time series forecasting tasks. Our experiments utilize the Jena weather dataset and Appliance Energy Usage time series for evaluation. The experimental results reveal that variations of the LSTM model outperform the most popular LSRM cell format in terms of error rate and training time. Specifically, the variations identified in this paper demonstrate superior generalization capabilities and yield reduced forecasting errors.},
