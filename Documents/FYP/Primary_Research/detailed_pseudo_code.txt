1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
1.1 Load ocean current data
- Read ocean current data from NetCDF or similar file formats.

1.2 Load historical weather data
- Read historical weather data from Excel, CSV, or other sources.
- Extract relevant weather variables like wind speed, wind direction, etc.

1.3 Preprocess and clean the data
- Handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies.
- Normalize or standardize the data as required.

1.4 Feature engineering for weather data
- Create additional features that might be useful for machine learning, like moving averages of wind speed, etc.

2. Machine Learning Model for Weather Prediction
2.1 Select an appropriate ML model
- Choose a model suitable for time-series data, such as LSTM, ARIMA, or Prophet.

2.2 Train the ML model
- Split the historical weather data into training and test sets.
- Train the model on the training set.

2.3 Evaluate the model
- Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

2.4 Model tuning
- If the model's performance is not satisfactory, tune its hyperparameters or consider using a different model.

3. Initialization of Physics-based Model
3.1 Initialize particles
- Generate initial coordinates for particles based on specified or random locations.

3.2 Initialize variables and constants
- Set up any other initial conditions, parameters, or constants needed for the simulation.

4. Core Advection Scheme with AI Component
4.1 For each time step:
  - 4.1.1 Use ML model to predict future weather
    - Input current and past weather conditions into the ML model to forecast future conditions.
  - 4.1.2 Calculate advection
    - Use both ocean currents and predicted weather conditions to calculate particle advection.
  - 4.1.3 Incorporate uncertainty
    - If the ML model provides confidence intervals, incorporate this as an uncertainty measure in the advection calculations.

5. Eddy Diffusivity and Random Walk
5.1 For each particle:
  - Apply a random walk algorithm to simulate the effect of eddy diffusivity on particle movement.

6. Time Evolution and Trajectory Calculation
6.1 Update particle positions
- Use the calculated advection and random walk to update each particle's position.

6.2 Record positions
- Store the new positions for later analysis and visualization.

7. Visualization and Analysis
7.1 Produce visualizations
- Generate concentration maps or other relevant visualizations.

7.2 Analysis
- Identify areas where there is a high probability of debris accumulation.

8. Evaluation and Iteration
8.1 Assess performance
- Evaluate how well the combined model performs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

8.2 Re-train and fine-tune
- As more data becomes available, re-train the ML model and make any necessary adjustments to the physics-based model.
